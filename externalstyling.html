    <h1>Full Stack JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      JavaScript has been around for over 20 years. It is the dominant
      programming language in web development. In the beginning JavaScript was a
      language for the web client (browser). Then came the ability to use
      JavaScript on the web server (with Node.js). Today the hottest buzzword is
      "Full Stack JavaScript". The idea of "Full Stack JavaScript" is that all
      software in a web application, both client side and server side, should be
      written using JavaScript only.
